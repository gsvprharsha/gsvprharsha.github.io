#### External Content

If you want your project, post or even the page to refer to an external resource, _**google.com** for example_, just add the following attribute to your front matter:

```yaml
---
external_url: https://google.com/
---
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**  
> You can change `external_new_tab` in `_config.yml` to make the external URLs open in a new tab.
